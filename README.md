# gemini ai tutor
Using gemini not api. because it is expensive..
With selenium and TTS and STT, implement AI tutor program

# How to use
- It require gemini login with google
- so that, must require google id and password
- currently implement dotenv library to use id and password
- and then, just go ahead compile and run

# Limitation
- STT is so slow
- Receiving answer of gemini is too slow

i think Solving this issue, using api is only way
Using another TTS library is another way to use this program.
